    <h2>Japanese FOOD is <u>Oishii!</u></h2>
    <p>It's probably no surprise that Japanese cuisine <strong>(Washoku, 和食)</strong> is a gastronomical experience attracting people with curiosity and fascination. Speaking for myself, I could probably live in Japan for the rest of my life because there's so much delicious food to eat. 
      <br> It's not only about Sushi but also many other traditional dishes that you can try. <strong>Sukiyaki (すき焼き) and Shabu Shabu (しゃぶしゃぶ)</strong> with lots of fresh vegetables, for example, are dishes that I appreciate.</p>

    <h2>Onsen (Natural Hot springs) is <u> Kimochi</u>! </h2>
    <p>Visiting a hot spring <strong> (Onsen, 温泉)</strong> in Japan is one of my absolute favorite things to do. The best thing about them is that they exist in almost every region. In many cities, a <strong>Sentō (銭湯)</strong>  is preferred instead of Onsens. 
      <br> A Sentō is more like a public bathing facility where the water comes from heated tap water rather than natural undergrown sources like Onsens. Wether I visit an Onsen alone, with family, or with friends, it will always be a few hours of rejuvenation.</p>
